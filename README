bsdgames-osx: the classic bsdgames ported to Mac OS X
-----------------------------------------------------

These are the classic bsdgames of old. They've been imported from DragonFly 
BSD's sources (the games in Dragonfly BSD can be found at 
http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/dragonfly.git/tree/v2.4.0:/games), along with 
some patches from FreeBSD ports, and only modified enough to get them to build 
on Mac OS X. 

WARNING: These games could conceivably be a security risk (that's the warning I
remember seeing with bsdgames in FreeBSD). If this is a concern, don't install
them. I am also not responsible if they blow up your computer, lure aliens to 
your house, run up huge credit card bills, eat your dog, or give you a menacing
side-eye. There's also NO WARRANTY, implied or otherwise.

INSTALLATION
------------

bsdmake is needed to build the games. If needed, you can install it out of 
homebrew (it doesn't come with recent versions of Xcode).

These games have been built on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and 10.8 Mountain Lion. They 
seem to build best with clang - if the compiler complains about redundant 
declarations, "CC=clang bsdmake" seems to work wonders. For me it was defaulting
to clang on Mountain Lion, but to gcc on Lion. Other versions of Mac OS X have
not been tested.

Installation is pretty basic. The steps are to run "bsdmake", then "sudo 
bsdmake install", and it will install in /usr/local (or elsewhere, if you edit 
the Makefile). A homebrew formula will be coming soon as well to make it even
easier. See BUGS for information for 10.7 users (at least), however.

BUGS
----
Currently the only game failing to build is hunt. hunt is now building on 10.7,
but libwrap and tcpd.h were removed in Mountain Lion, and the huntd server 
needs it to compile. Thus, while the hunt client builds on Mountain Lion, hunt
as a whole is still not working on Mountain Lion.

Many of these programs have hard coded paths. Currently all of them are now
changed to sensible defaults under /usr/local, but if you want to install 
somewhere that *isn't* /usr/local, you'll need to find and update the paths.

morse and piano have been removed because they depend on sound stuff that's not 
readily available on OS X. dm was removed because, well, no one would want to
deal with it anyway.

fortune has been removed because it is readily available elsewhere, and in fact
has its own homebrew formula. It's best not to duplicate it here.

If you use the bsdmake in /usr/bin on 10.7 (and probably before), it will try
to install as root by default. Either install the bsdmake from homebrew and use
the homebrew version (you'll need to directly use the version in 
/usr/local/Cellar) or set BINOWN, BINGRP, LIBOWN, LIBGRP, etc. to the user and
groups you want.
