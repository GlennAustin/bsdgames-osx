bsdgames-osx: the classic bsdgames ported to Mac OS X
-----------------------------------------------------

These are the classic bsdgames of old. They've been imported from DragonFly 
BSD's sources (the games in Dragonfly BSD can be found at 
http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/dragonfly.git/tree/v2.4.0:/games), and only
modified enough to get them to build on Mac OS X. 

Games included are:

	adventure 
	arithmetic 
	atc 
	backgammon 
	battlestar 
	bcd 
	bs 
	caesar 
	canfield 
	cribbage 
	dm 
	factor 
	fish 
	fortune 
	grdc 
	hack 
	hangman 
	hunt 
	larn 
	mille 
	morse 
	number 
	phantasia 
	piano 
	pig 
	pom 
	ppt 
	primes 
	quiz 
	rain 
	random 
	robots 
	rogue 
	sail 
	snake 
	trek 
	wargames 
	worm 
	worms 
	wump

INSTALLATION

BUGS
----
Currently not all of the bsdgames are building on Mac OS X. The games that are
not building are listed in the file FAILING. As they're fixed, they'll be moved
out of FAILING.
